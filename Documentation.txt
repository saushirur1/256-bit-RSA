This Project Consists of 4 Classes
1. Init
2. Customer
3. Bank
4. Merchant

Init
-->Take inputs such as Name,SSN and the money order amount from the User.


Customer
-->It creates Random number of money orders.
-->Secret splitting done to split Identity (name+SSN) into two parts
-->Bit commitment to commit the hash values
-->Blind the money orders using RSA.

Bank
--> Selects one random order to blindly sign.
--> Signs this order using private key.
--> Before Signing checks if all the other orders have the same money order amount.
--> Writes all the unique ID's in the money order into a file.

Merchant
--> Gets the decrypted signed message from the Customer
--> Customer verifies the Signature of the Bank and decrypts the message using the public key of the Bank
--> Sends a radom challenge bit string to the Customer
--> Customer sends the left(R) or right(S) values corresponding to the Challenge bits. ((R)xor(name+SSN)=(S))
Customer sends R for 0 challenge bit and S for 1 challenge bit
--> Merchant verfies the hash value and sends the order to the bank
